# ZKP-inscriptions

This example generates a random 32-byte secret key and a random ordinal value, and then creates a Pedersen commitment to the value using the secp256k1 library. It then generates a Bulletproof for the commitment using the secp256k1_bulletproofs library, and encodes the inscription data as a hex string. It creates a Bitcoin transaction that includes the inscription data as an additional output, and broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include error checking or handling of all possible edge cases. It is also important to use secure random number generation when generating secret keys and other sensitive data. Also, this example should not be used as a real-world implementation without further security review and auditing.
